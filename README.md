# jndn-mock

This project consists of tools for testing NDN applications without network IO. It relies on the [NDN Protocol](https://named-data.net) and its associated [client library](https://github.com/named-data/jndn).

## Install

With Maven, add the following to your POM:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.intel.jndn.mock</groupId>
  <artifactId>jndn-mock</artifactId>
  <version>RELEASE</version> <!-- or a specific version -->
</dependency>
```

## Use

`MockFace` is a test tool that can be passed to applications instead of a network IO `Face`; management of the `Face.processEvents()` is still the user's responsibility, though this may change in a future release. For example:
```java
Face face = new MockFace();
face.expressInterest(interest, onData, onTimeout);
face.processEvents();
```

When using the `MockFace`, retrieve statistics about sent/received Interests and Data packets like:
```java
MockFace face = new MockFace();
assertEquals(0, face.sentDatas.size());
assertEquals(0, face.sentInterests.size());

face.expressInterest(interest, onData, onTimeout);
...
face.processEvents();
...
assertEquals(1, face.sentInterests.size());
```
